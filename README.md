# Prime Player for Google Play Music

### Fork By clementlamoureux

Hello ! This is my fork to adapt this great chrome extensions for the new Opera 18. There is no modifications for the moment, but you can download the package directly to add this extensions to your Opera browser.

You can download it here : (http://www.clementlamoureux.fr/operaMusic.nex)

Please red this :

This fork was made only for personnal use, so I change the shortcut to this:
- Play/Pause => Alt+P
- Next song => Alt+N
- That's all !


### Description

This is the repository for the Chrome extension for Google Play Music.
It is based on ideas of the extension "Better Music For Google Music".

Features include:

* last.fm integration (now playing, scrobbling, like/unlike)
* a powerful miniplayer with different layouts and color schemes
* toast notifications
* support for thumbs and 5-star ratings
* and more

You can install it from [here] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prime-player-for-google-p/npngaakpdgeaajbnidkkginekmnaejbi).

### Notes for contributers

If you find any bugs or would like to see new features, please file an issue here on GitHub or - even better - send a pull request.
Please use the "develop" branch for contributing, as I use [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
(I know, that's pushing it a bit, but I try to learn sth. on developing this).

If you need to change the CSS for the popup/miniplayer/toast, you'll need [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
You can use the script watch-sass.sh for convenience then.
